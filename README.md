## ATAC-seq Data Analysis Pipeline with Snakemake
# Overview
This pipeline is designed for the analysis of ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) data. It automates the process from raw data processing to the identification of accessible chromatin regions, peak calling, and downstream analysis. Built with Snakemake, this pipeline ensures reproducibility and scalability, accommodating datasets ranging from a few samples to large-scale projects.

# Features
Quality Control: Utilizes tools like FastQC and MultiQC for quality assessment of raw sequencing data.
Alignment: Aligns reads to the reference genome using Bowtie2 or BWA.
Peak Calling: Identifies regions of increased accessibility using MACS2.
Downstream Analysis: Includes differential accessibility analysis, motif enrichment analysis, and integration with other genomic data.
Visualization: Generates plots and heatmaps for quality control and result interpretation.

# Installation
Prerequisites
Conda/Miniconda (recommended for managing environments)
Snakemake
Python 3.x
R (for some downstream analyses)
Setting Up the Environment
Install Miniconda (if not already installed): Miniconda Installation Guide

# Clone this repository:
git clone 
cd atac-seq-pipeline

# Output
The pipeline generates several output directories, including:

qc/: Quality control reports for raw and processed data.
aligned/: BAM files of aligned reads.
peaks/: Peak calling results, including bed files and visualization plots.
results/: Final analysis results and figures.

# Contributing
Contributions to improve the pipeline or add new features are welcome. Please submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss your ideas.
